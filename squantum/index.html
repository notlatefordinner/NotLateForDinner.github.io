      <h2>SQUANTUM’S EARLY RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS</h2>
  <p>In 1906, the City of Quincy Atlas recorded 29 buildings in Squantum. Believing that the peninsula would be an attractive place to live, in 1907 real estate developers Carl E. Carlson and John R. Nelson purchased 100 of Squantum’s 275 acres, much of which had been the Titus Estate. Before this, it had been the Pratt and Huckins farms.</p>
  <p>Carlson and Nelson divided the land, which ran from East Squantum and Dorchester Streets to Bayside Road, into 914 lots of between 3,000-7,000 square feet each. These sold from six to 15 cents per square foot. The houses built on these lots began Squantum’s transformation from farms and a resort “village” to a permanent residential community.  Large houses were built as summer “estates.” Smaller summer cottages, without insulation heat or electricity, were constructed as well. Many residents were summer-residents only, and Squantum was still considered “outpost” that generated few votes – and taxes.</p>
  <p>Sections of the peninsula took on inhabitants’ characteristics, and neighborhoods were named. While these names appear don’t appear on official maps, they are preserved in the writing of Squantum historians Bud Sumner and Gordon Nelson.</p>

<h3  id="swedeville">SWEDEVILLE</h3>
  <p>Carlson and Nelson were active in one of Boston’s Swedish churches, and sold house lots to church members. Families of Swedish descent moved to the peninsula, settling near relatives and friends, as did most immigrants, in a section that became known as Swedeville. The group sustained themselves by farming, growing vegetables and raising hens, and by fishing and catching eels in Quincy Bay.</p>
  <p>Families typically constructed houses themselves, with the help of friends and relatives. Early Swedish family names in Squantum were Anderson, Dahlquist, Friberg, Gran, Halgren, Halsworth, Hanson, Johnson, Nelson, Nickerson, Olson, Swanson, Swenson and Uppling.</p>

      <h3  id="squashhollow">SQUASH HOLLOW</h3>  
             <p>Squash Hollow, in the northeast section of the peninsula, roughly bordered by Dorchester Street, Moon Island Road, the northern part of Bayside Road and part of Bellevue Road. Its southern border was near Bayberry Road. Many of Irish descent built houses here, often small summer cottage, some which still stand. Some had worked on the Moon Island Sewage project and, liking the place, stayed.  Bud Sumner notes, “Although there never was any real animosity among the groups, woe to the young lady from Swedeville who was discovered hanging around Squash Hollow by her parents!”</p>
  <p>Sumner’s parents built a summer cottage Squash Hollow on Agawam Street. Streets were muddy, and outhouses, known as back-houses, were typically. Sumner notes that many back-houses were built by amateur builders, and that they overflowed onto the dirt streets in spring rains. Johnny Mack, lived up the hill on Standish Road near Shoreham Street, nicknamed Agawam Street ‘Cystern Boulevard.’</p> 
  <p>Gordon Nelson points out that there was a great deal of intermarriage between Squantum’s Irish and Swedish denizens, “and it was fun to see that the President of the Swedish Viking club was often a man with an Irish name - - he probably married a Squantum Swedish girl.” </p>

<h3  id="societyhill">SOCIETY HILL</h3>  
  <p>The nickname Society Hill reflects the fact that social units were more clearly defined in the early 20th century. The “very well-to-do” built summer homes and estates built in Squantum, tending to build on a large swathe of land on the peninsulas’ southeast side, on or near Quincy Bay. Estate owners could easily sail, boat, swim, fish and enjoy the views and summer breezes from the wide open porches that were a common feature of many houses.</p>
  <p>Society Hill was loosely bound by many of the streets leading from Bellevue Road to Quincy Bay, roughly from Bayberry Road to Surfside Lane. </p>
  <p>The house on the corner of Brunswick Street and Bayside Road was called Banker’s Point, as it was owned by Tom Harper, Vice President in the State Street Trust Company. In the late 1920s the house was enlarged and became the Squantum Women’s Club “East Ledge”. The house still stands.</p>

             <h3  id="popefarm">POPE FARM/SHORE ACRES</h3> 
  <p>Pope Farm, later called Shore Acres, was a rounded hill of quality land between Sonoma and Crabtree Roads from East Squantum Street to Landsdowne Street. This property originally belonged to the Pope family, whose house stood near the intersection of East Squantum Street and Crabtree Road. Pope’s Creek, which cuts in to the large marsh that one sees when driving into Squantum, was named for the Pope family.</p>

             <h3  id="crabtree">CRABTREE ESTATE</h3>  
  <p>Crabtree Estate was, literally, Lotta Crabtree’s estate, originally belonging to Gottlieb Friedrich Burkhardt, who bought the land from John Pratt in 1871. It was roughly bounded by Sonoma and Dundee Roads from East Squantum Street to Carrigg Street. The estate came with a large summer house, barns, stables, a guest house and four summer cottages. A water tower stood on the hill, with a windmill that pumped water from a spring near the end of Aberdeen Road near East Squantum Street. A pipe ran up to a fieldstone base that supported a wooden cylindrical tank. The water tower’s the stone base still stands on Woodbriar Road. Granite markers bearing the names of Sonoma Girl and Ruby Royal are also nearby, and one of the estate’s four cottage still stands on Seal Rock Lane.</p>
  <p>Crabtree loved racehorses, and kept a bay mare named Lotta Crabtree in Squantum. (It was a trend to name horses after actresses.) Crabtree’s brother Jack spent a great deal of time in Squantum. the estate. Jack liked privacy, installing a sign at the property’s entrance that read "Beware of the Bull” although no bull was on the premises. Street names commemorate Lotta’s peninsula presence: Crabtree Road, Livesey was her mother’s maiden name, and Sonoma Road was named after Sonoma Girl, a racehorse. Ashworth Street bears Jack Crabtree’s middle name.</p>
  <p>When Crabtree died, most of the land was put up for sale in 1924. Crabtree Road is an attractive section of Squantum whose houses display a variety of styles, from the Moore’s Bauhaus white house, to modern houses,, many with direct beachfront and outstanding water views.</p>

             <h3  id="sandpit">THE SANDPIT</h3>  
  <p>The Sandpit was a flat, sandy area that is now Essex, Heath, Deerfield and Lansdowne Streets. Originally it had been called the Little Neck. When it was owned by Lillie Huckins Titus, the land held birch trees, and was home to many birds. Children played on its roadless and house-less expand. </p>
  <p>Titus sold sand from the Sandpit, which gave it its name. She charged residents fifty cents for each load of sand, although many Squantumites simply carted it away. She also sold sand to the City of Quincy to raise causeway, which, because of its proximity to the marsh, often flooded. In the winter when rainwater froze, the Sandpit became a natural ice skating pond.</p>

             <h3  id="middleville">MIDDLEVILLE</h3>  
  <p>It’s not clear if Middleville was actually used to describe this section of Squantum, or if it was applied casually to describe the peninsula’s center. In any case, Middleville was roughly bounded by Dorchester Street, East Squantum Street, Pratt Road, Dundee Road and Bellevue Road, and wasn’t heavily developed until the 1940s. </p>
  <p>In Squantum’s early residential days, the intersection of East Squantum and Dorchester Streets meet was called Post Office Square because of the post office in the Watts store; this was in what would be called Middleville. The section also contains Squantum School, the fire station, and Squantum’s small business district. After World War 2, many houses, often in t the Cape Cod style, were built throughout Middleville, as well as in the Sandpit area. These were to meet the demand of returning veterans who, as the result of the GI bill, could now afford mortgages, and who wanted to raise their families in the suburbs.</p>
