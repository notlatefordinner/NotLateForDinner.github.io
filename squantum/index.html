  <h2>SQUANTUM’S EARLY RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS</h2>
  <p>In 1906, the City of Quincy Atlas recorded 29 buildings in Squantum. Believing that the peninsula would be an attractive place to live, in 1907 real estate developers Carl E. Carlson and John R. Nelson purchased 100 of Squantum’s 275 acres, much of which had been the Titus Estate. Before this, it had been the Pratt and Huckins farms.</p>
<br>  
  <p>Carlson and Nelson divided the land, which ran from East Squantum and Dorchester Streets to Bayside Road, into 914 lots of between 3,000-7,000 square feet each. These sold from six to 15 cents per square foot. The houses built on these lots began Squantum’s transformation from farms and a resort “village” to a permanent residential community.  Large houses were built as summer “estates.” Smaller summer cottages, without insulation heat or electricity, were constructed as well. Many residents were summer-residents only, and Squantum was still considered “outpost” that generated few votes – and taxes.</p>
<br>
  <p>Sections of the peninsula took on inhabitants’ ‘characteristics, and neighborhoods were named. While these names appear don’t appear on official maps, they are preserved in the writing of Squantum historians Bud Sumner and Gordon Nelson.</p>
